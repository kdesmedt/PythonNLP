Various writing systems (scripts) are in use for the world's languages. Many languages, such as English and Norwegian, have an *alphabet* with letters which have some phonemic value. Chinese has morpho-syllabic characters. The Hangul (Korean) script combines the features of an alphabetic and syllabic writing system. In addition, most writing systems use additional characters such as punctuation, spaces, quotation marks, numerals, etc. Whatever the system, all scripts have units that we call *characters*.\n","\n","There is no one-to-one correspondence between a language and a script.\n","Turkmen has been written in variants of the Arabic, Cyrillic and Latin scripts. Serbo-Croatian medieval texts were written in five scripts: Latin, Glagolitic, Early Cyrillic, Bosnian Cyrillic and a variant of Arabic. Chinese has two main scripts, traditional and simplified.\n","\n","Conversely, a script may be used to write several different languages, often with some variation.\n","Variants of the Latin script are used to write\n","English, German, French, Norwegian, Vietnamese and many other languages.\n","The Devanagari script is used for several languages of India and Nepal.\n","\n","*Encodings* are digital representations of characters so that every character is represented by a number (often written as hexadecimal bytes). The default encoding for strings in Python3 is UTF-8, which can represent the whole [Unicode](https://home.unicode.org/) character set. Unicode has about 15000 code points and accommodates characters of almost all scripts in use today, as well as some historical ones. In addition, Unicode has characters for emojis, phonetic symbols, arrows, mathematical symbols, music notation, etc.\n","\n","*Fonts* contain typographically defined shapes to make characters appear on the screen in a particular style. Whereas the Unicode inventory is very large, the set of defined shapes in most fonts is quite limited. There are specialized fonts for certain character sets. *Whether or not a particular character appears correctly on the screen is dependent on the font that is used!*\n","\n","So, Python strings are sequences of Unicode code points for characters. Strings cannot be changed, but can be copied and transformed into new strings.\n","This notebook shows some examples of how strings in some scripts are handled in Python. Most string operations work fine for most writing systems, but there are some special cases to be aware of.\n","\n","---"],"metadata":{"id":"MiclnOqvYx76"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"WBMU510geChO"},"source":["##Case methods and normalization\n","\n","Some but not all scripts make a distinction between uppercase (capitals) and lowercase.
