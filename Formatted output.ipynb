Try printing a number with more decimals, and with 0 decimals.\n","2.   Rewrite the function `print_trip` from an earlier notebook so that it uses f-strings for the outputs. This makes it easier to include a period at the end without having a space in front of it.\n","3.   (optional) Write a function to turn a list of numbers like `v` into this kind of string: `'4, 2, 3, 1.5, 5, 4 and 0'`. One possible solution is to first use a comprehension to turn every number into a string. Then use `.join` to put commas between all elements except the last. Then concatenate this with ` and ` as well as the last element converted to a string"]}]}
