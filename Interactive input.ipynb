Modify `guess_word` so that if the user types `stop`, the `while` iteration stops. Use `and` to join this second condition.\n","2.   Add a limit to the number of wrong guesses.\n","3.   Write a function `print_mean` which asks the user to type some integers, separated by space, on a line. Print the mean, using the function `mean_value` from an earlier notebook. The input string will have to be split and converted to a list of integers. Use a comprehension for this conversion.\n","4.
